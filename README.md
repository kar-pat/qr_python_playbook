This repo consists of my answers to the Python playbook questions and coding excericses



# Python Playbook
Supporting materials for the Python playbook.

The directory structure is organised to match the playbook sections and subsections.

Not all subsections are represented here as they do not all have supplementary material.

Each subsection contains a `Questions.md` file with a list of questions.

Some subsections also contain a `coding_exercise.py` with instructions.
