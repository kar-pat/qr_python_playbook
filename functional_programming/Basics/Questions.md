What is functional programming?
Functional Programming is a programming paradigm wherein the primary method of computation is through functions.

When/why is it useful?
Functional Programming is useful because of the following reasons:
1. Ease of debugging: Writing functions that take input and genereate an output wihtout changing the state of any variable. This makes debugging easier as it becomes easier to spot bugs and tackle them.
2. Modularity: It allows to make modules
3. Provability

What are the basic properties of a function required for functional programming and how does Python support this?
The basic properties of a function are the ability to take an argument and to return a function to a caller. Since evertythin in Python is an object, functions are first class citizens, therefore satisfying both of the above requirements.


What are side effects?
Side effects are   the changes to the interal state of the funciton or other changes that aren't visibile to a function's return value.

How do you define anonymous functions?
Anonynmous functions are functions that are defined without a name, e.g. lambda function in python.
