"""
Write a recursive function to reverse a sequence.

>>> reverse('abcdef')
'fedcba'
>>> reverse([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
>>> reverse(('x', 'y', 'z', 1, 2))
(2, 1, 'z', 'y', 'x')

Is your function tail recursive?

If it isn't, how can you change it so that it is?

Given what you have just learned about recursion in Python,
which solution do you prefer and why?
